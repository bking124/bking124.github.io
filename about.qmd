My name is Brian King, and I am currently a Senior ML Research Engineer at [Arm](https://www.arm.com/), working on building machine learning solutions for more efficient hardware verification. I recently graduated from Rice University with a PhD in Statistics, where I was advised by [Daniel Kowal](http://www.danielrkowal.com/). My doctoral research focused on Bayesian models for forecasting time series of counts, including both methodological contributions and open-source software, in particular the R package [countSTAR](https://bking124.github.io/countSTAR/). In addition to time series and Bayesian statistics, I am interested in a wide variety of other topics such as text analytics and causal inference.

I am always looking for opportunities to share ideas broadly as well as learn more from others. Towards that end, I have contributed as a writer to [MathStatBites](https://mathstatbites.org/), which aims to produce accessible summaries of recent research in mathematics and statistics. Several of my posts have also been featured on a similar project, [DataScienceBites](https://realworlddatascience.net/ideas/datasciencebites/). More recently, I have sought to become more involved in my local data science community by participating in the [Austin ML Journal Club](https://austinmljournalclub.github.io/), organized by [Hongsup Shin](https://hongsupshin.github.io/).

Outside of the technical realm, I enjoy cooking, exploring new restaurants, playing basketball, watching football, and getting outdoors (when the Texas heat isn't too bad). I'm also quite passionate about learning new languages, and have spent significant time studying Spanish and Mandarin.
