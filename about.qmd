I am a PhD Student in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rice.edu) at Rice University, advised by [Dr. Daniel Kowal](http://www.danielrkowal.com/).  My research focuses on Bayesian modeling and forecasting for time series of counts, but I am also interested in a wide variety of other topics such as text analytics and causal inference.  I am currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.

Prior to coming to Rice, I graduated from Baylor University in 2018 with a double major in Mathematics and Statistics alongside a secondary major in Spanish and a minor in Computer Science.

When I have a bit of free time, I love to get outdoors or play some sports (particularly basketball). I also try to travel whenever I get the opportunity, and when I don't have that chance, I like to substitute the traveling with exploring new foods, either by cooking at home or by checking out new restaurants.
