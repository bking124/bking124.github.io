    "text": "I am very happy to announce that my paper “Warped Dynamic Linear Models for Time Series of Counts” (discussed in a previous post) has officially been accepted to Bayesian Analysis! It was a long journey, but I’m quite proud of the finished product and honored to join the list of those published in a journal I really admire and often browse.\nIn other news, I’ve also recently been hard at work on an R software package called countSTAR, which was recently accepted to CRAN! This package implements a family of count-valued models built around Simultaneous Transformation and Rounding (STAR), thus synthesizing a large body of research by my advisor Daniel Kowal (and collaborators) into frequentist and Bayesian approaches for count-valued tabular data. It also incorporates some basic warpDLM models for those interested in time series analysis. For more details, check out the package website and accompanying vignette."

    "text": "My name is Brian King, and I am currently a Senior ML Research Engineer at Arm, working on building machine learning solutions for more efficient hardware verification. I graduated in 2023 from Rice University with a PhD in Statistics, where I was advised by Daniel Kowal. My doctoral research focused on Bayesian models for forecasting time series of counts, including both methodological contributions and open-source software, in particular the R package countSTAR. In addition to time series and Bayesian statistics, I am interested in a wide variety of other topics such as text analytics and causal inference.\nI am always looking for opportunities to share ideas broadly as well as learn more from others. Towards that end, I have contributed as a writer to MathStatBites, which aims to produce accessible summaries of recent research in mathematics and statistics. Several of my posts have also been featured on a similar project, DataScienceBites. More recently, I have sought to become more involved in my local data science community by participating in the Austin ML Journal Club, organized by Hongsup Shin.\nOutside of the technical realm, I enjoy cooking, exploring new restaurants, playing basketball, watching football, and getting outdoors (when the Texas heat isn’t too bad). I’m also quite passionate about learning new languages, and have spent significant time studying Spanish and Mandarin.\nFeel free to reach out via email or any of the platforms shown below!"

    "text": "It’s several months late, but I wanted to announce my first paper, written with my advisor Daniel Kowal, entitled Warped Dynamic Linear Models for Time Series of Counts. The basic idea is to harness the flexibility of Dynamic Linear Models, but in such a way that we produce a coherent model for count and integer-valued data (e.g. the data-generating process is itself integer-valued). As it turns out, our method also has some unique connections with a distribution known as the selection-normal, and we are able to derive some interesting theory underlying our warpDLM framework. Of course, that’s just the tip of the iceberg, so I definitely encourage you to check out the paper! Code to reproduce the results from the paper is also available on Github.\nI’m also very happy to announce that this work was selected for several student paper awards. First, it was chosen to receive one of the International Biometric Society (IBS) Eastern North America Region (ENAR) Distinguished Student Paper Awards. I will present my research at the 2022 ENAR Spring Meeting held in Houston. Second, I’m also honored to say my paper was selected by both the Business and Economic Statistics and Bayesian Statistical Science sections of the ASA in their Student Paper Award competitions. Students can only accept one award, so I have accepted that of the Section for Bayesian Statistical Science. I will have the opportunity to present at the 2022 Joint Statistical Meetings held in Washington, D.C.\nCheck out the articles here and here about me and my fellow Rice PhD students who are doing some fantastic work!\n\n\n\nA fun artistic rendering of the paper’s title…generate your own"
